# Task Management Application

## Overview

This project is a Spring Boot-based **Task Management Application** that allows users to manage tasks effectively. It demonstrates the use of REST APIs, database integration, and test-driven development principles.

## Features

- **User Management**:
    - Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
    - Assign tasks to users.
- **Task Management**:
    - Create, view, update, and delete tasks.
    - Associate tasks with users.
    - Retrieve tasks for a specific user.
- **Database Integration**:
    - Data persistence using Spring Data JPA.
    - Entities: `User` and `Task` with a one-to-many relationship.
- **Validation**:
    - Input validation using Jakarta Bean Validation (e.g., `@NotBlank`, `@Size`).
- **Testing**:
    - Unit tests for user classes.
    - Partial tests for task classes (to be completed).
- **API Documentation**:
    - Swagger integration attempted but pending proper implementation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.1**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Jakarta Validation**
- **Lombok**
- **H2 Database** (in-memory database for testing)
- **Mockito** (for unit testing)

## Known Issues

1. **Lombok-related Problems**:
    - Getters generated by Lombok are sometimes not recognized by the service layer.
    - This issue causes intermittent failures during testing.
2. **Testing**:
    - Unit tests for `Task` services and controller are incomplete.
    - Further testing is required for edge cases and error scenarios.
3. **Swagger**:
    - Swagger documentation integration is partially implemented but not functional.
4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:
    - DTOs are not currently implemented. This could improve data handling and API responses.
5. **Behavior of Task Endpoints**:
    - Tasks can be created without assigning a user upfront. This is functional but not ideal from a logical standpoint.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArielaFitia/taskmanagement.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. Access the application:
    - API base URL: `http://localhost:8080`

## API Endpoints

### User Endpoints
- **POST /users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /users**: Retrieve all users.
- **GET /users/{id}**: Retrieve a specific user.
- **PUT /users/{id}**: Update a user.
- **DELETE /users/{id}**: Delete a user.

### Task Endpoints
- **POST /tasks**: Create a new task.
- **GET /tasks**: Retrieve all tasks.
- **GET /tasks/{id}**: Retrieve a specific task.
- **PUT /tasks/{id}**: Update a task.
- **DELETE /tasks/{id}**: Delete a task.

## Future Enhancements

- Complete unit tests for `TaskService` and `TaskController`.
- Implement DTOs for cleaner API responses.
- Fix Swagger integration for proper API documentation.
- Add global exception handling for better error management.
